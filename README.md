# Nix-On-MacOS
dotfiles on macOS & a memo of the commands used for nix on macOS

---

- [darwin-configuration.nix][] is the file equivalent to **configuration.nix** on NixOS. If you want to use that feature on macOS, see [nix-darwin][].
- Use [Home-manager][] to config [zsh][], [bat][], [tmux][] and [newsboat][] and install packages.
- Also, you can take a look at [MacOS Nix Setup (an alternative to Homebrew)][].
- You can see the command in [nixCommand.md][].
- Here is [the skills of using vim and zsh][].
- Here is the manual for me to set up a brand new mac in the future.
- I also put my `tmux.conf`, `.zshrc` and `.vimrc` here.
- `reattach-to-user-namespace` should be installed in order to communicate with system clipboard when in `tmux`. 
- Use [GoogleÊó•Êú¨Ë™ûÂÖ•Âäõ][] for inputting Japanese on my macOS.
- Use [RimeÈº†È¨öÁÆ°][] for inputting Chinese. I mainly use [Âú∞ÁêÉÊãºÈü≥][], but have [ÊúôÊúàÊãºÈü≥][] as a fallback.

## iiNA special config
Because `yt-dlp` is installed at `/run/current-system/sw/bin/yt-dlp` by `nix-darwin`, you would have to make a `soft-link` in `/usr/local/bin` to let **iiNA** use it.
```bash
cd /usr/local/bin

ln -s /run/current-system/sw/bin/yt-dlp /usr/bin/youtube-dl
```

## Note at 2025/5/1

IDK why nix-darwin is dead on my MacBook Air. So I removed it. Now I will just update nix by command below.
```
sudo nix-env --install --file '<nixpkgs>' --attr nix cacert -I nixpkgs=channel:nixpkgs-unstable
sudo launchctl remove org.nixos.nix-daemon
sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.nixos.nix-daemon.plist
```

You can also update `Nix` by 
```
sudo -i nix upgrade-nix
```

Then check the version of `Nix` by 

```
nix --version
```

And only install packages by `home-manager`.
